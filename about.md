        Legend has it that Wingmas started in 2016 as a celebration of two friend's love of the chicken wing. It has since expanded to a larger group of friends who enjoy spreading Wingmas cheer year after year. Each Wingmas is preceeded by a rigorous bout of planning and strategizing to curate a balanced dance card of poultry pushers. With the prep-work out of the way, the crew hops from establishment to establishment on the day of the event, ordering wings for everyone to sample. Based on market research, the sweet spot for number of establishments is 6, with a 2-3 wing intake at each establishment. Here a Wingmas, we're not about science and statistics, we simply know a good wing when we see, taste, and smell it.
