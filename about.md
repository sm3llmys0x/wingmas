        Legend has it that Wingmas started in 2016 as a celebration of two friend's love of the chicken wing. It has since expanded to a larger group of friends who enjoy spreading Wingmas cheer year after year. Each Wingmas is preceeded by a rigorous bout of planning and strategizing to curate a balanced dance card of poultry pushers. On Wingmas day, the crew hops from establishment to establishment, ordering wings for everyone to sample. Based on market research, six establishments at a two to three wing intake at each establishment is the sweet spot for Wingmas satisfaction. Here at Wingmas, we simply know a good wing when we see, smell, and taste it.
